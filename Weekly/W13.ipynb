Python actually has a much, much larger array of built-in functions, but to avoid bloating the language, they are available on a user-needs basis, in the form of libraries. A **library** is a collection of functions that relate to a particular style of analysis. For example, there is a library for basic mathematical and statistical functions, another library for advanced iterators, and a different library again for advanced data structures used for storage purposes.  Part of the popularity of Python is the exceptionally broad range of libraries, making computing easy in all sorts of different contexts.\n",
