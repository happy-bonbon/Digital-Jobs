What is printed is, perhaps surprisingly, the global variable rather than the local variable in `vowel_count()` (despite the function call to `vowel_count()` still being \"live\"). It turns out that the explanation for this is simple: when a variable is encountered in a function, Python first attempts to dereference it relative to the local namespace (of the local function call), and failing this, it attempts to dereference it relative to the *global* namespace, bypassing the local namespace of any other functions.

If the object grows a moustache (bad example, but you get the idea), irrespective of which name it goes under (`lst` or `lst2`), the moustache is visible to all. Thus, when we mutate an object (in a function, or via a second variable name for the same object), the mutation is reflected in all variables that are bound to the object. If, on the other hand, as part of the assignment to a variable/function call, we create a new object (i.e. we do anything other than assign directly to an existing variable), we lose all connection between the two objects.
